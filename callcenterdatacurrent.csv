Affected Property: 2860 N 10th St #2858, Milwaukee, WI 53206
Report Date: November 16, 2025
Reported by: The 2800 Block of N 9th St, Milwaukee, WI 53206

1. Description of the Condition Observed
The city-owned vacant lot at 2860 N 10th St #2858,  has been observed to have:

Tall grass and overgrown shrubs along the meridian wall shared with the neighboring property.

Areas where wind has caused trash and debris to accumulate among the overgrown vegetation.

These conditions create public health and safety hazards, provide shelter for rodents and pests, and negatively impact the neighborhood’s appearance and safety.

2. Possible Municipal Code Violations

According to the Milwaukee Code of Ordinances, Chapter 275 – Building Maintenance Code, Sections 275-32 and 275-39:

Vacant lots must be maintained free from tall grass, weeds, brush, and debris.

Owners (or city custodians, for city-owned lots) must prevent conditions that attract rodents or create nuisances, including accumulation of trash due to wind in overgrown areas.

Overgrown vegetation along walls shared with neighboring properties can contribute to hazards or vermin problems, and thus constitutes a violation.

3. Associated Risks

Accumulation of windblown debris and litter.
Shelter and harborage for rodents and insects.
Fire hazard from dry tall grass and brush.

Negative impact on neighboring property and overall neighborhood appearance.

4. Recommendation

It is recommended that the Department of Neighborhood Services (DNS) or the city:

 I am requesting four new garbage carts and one additional recycling cart for my property. The current garbage carts are in terrible condition—they have large holes, and squirrels are able to get inside and tear open garbage bags, creating a sanitation issue.  
Additionally, one of the garbage carts was taken by a garbage truck driver and never replaced. I’ve only had one recycling cart since I purchased the building three years ago, which is not sufficient for the volume of recyclables we produce.  

Please let me know the next steps to have these carts replaced or delivered. I can be reached at (414) 933-6181 or (414) 739-1492 Grissom.antoine@yahoo.com or Smjmil@gmail.com (Selina's email)

 Thank you for your assistance.

It turns out that the MKE Hop gets traffic light precedence throughout it's route.... this is ridiculous.  First, you hardly see anyone use the MKE HOP, second, the ability for vehicles to flow through traffic is greatly impeded, causing more delays and congestion on the city streets.

I'd imagine that the entire MKE Hop route is number 1 priority when it comes to traffic moving through the streets, which is absurd and the entire system needs to be changed.  Who thought of this when determining plans and route?

And how are traffic lights determined in the city? (sensor, timer, etc).

This needs to be fixed.

The sump pumps failed to handle the volume of water, causing sewage to flood the entire basement area, including the staircase. The water remained for approximately three days before the exterior floodwaters receded enough to allow access for pumping.

Due to the prolonged exposure to sewage:

Drywall had to be removed.

Furance: Stopped working circut board need to be replaced.

Water Heater: stopped working will need to be replaced. 

The entire basement floor and base areas required repeated treatment with bleach and bacterial enzyme to sanitize the space.

Dear Department of Public Works,

I am writing to urgently report a very large and hazardous pothole located on Grant Blvd. at the intersection with Meinecke St. The pothole spans more than half of the street, and debris is dislodged whenever vehicles drive over it. This poses a serious danger to children who play nearby, pedestrians, and parked vehicles.

The condition is deteriorating rapidly, and I am deeply concerned about the risk of accidents or injuries if it is not addressed promptly. I respectfully request immediate attention and repair of this matter before it worsens further.

Thank you for your prompt response and commitment to community safety.

I witnessed it through my fence. Now they have this other dog that sounds much bigger and is always outside barking & whining. 7908 W Herbert Ave is the address where this is taking place. The yard has a massive trampoline & a good size pool for the kids. But NO attention or care  is being given to this dog. It’s being neglected & most likely mentally & physically abused .  I have 4 dogs of my own and this treatment of this poor dog is unacceptable. Being an army vet, prior law enforcement this is very disturbing to me. If someone can’t take care of or treat a pet as part of a family then there is no need to have a pet in the first place. Before this dog suffers anymore abuse PLEASE HAVE someone investigate this problem and get this dog to a family that cares. The current owners obviously don’t care. They physical abused their first dog (I witnessed that) & now the same treatment to the current dog.

Unfortunately, the work performed has left my property in an unacceptable and unsafe condition, and despite my attempts to resolve this matter with the contractor, it remains unresolved.

Unfinished Yard and Safety Hazards
* My yard is still torn up from the excavation, which makes it difficult to mow and maintain.
* Concrete forms from sidewalk pour remain in place with iron spikes protruding from the ground, posing a clear safety hazard.
* It appears that no one intends to return and properly restore the property.

Damage to Electrical Service 
During the excavation, the contractor struck the electrical service drop with their excavator, knocking it completely off the house. These wires supply power from the utility pole to my property. I was never contacted about this incident. Instead, my tenants were told that power would be restored around noon that day as this happened in the morning. I did not become aware of the outage until 11:00 p.m., when my tenants called upset to report that the house was really cold and still without power.
The electrical service was reattached in a questionable manner:
* The ceramic-headed screw-in bolt that secures the service wires to the house was damaged and now sits crooked in my opinion.
* The metal mast mounted to the side of my property is missing its protective cap. This mast houses the electrical wires running from the exterior of my home to the interior basement panel, and without the cap, the connection is potentially exposed.
* A piece of""2025-08-19 00:00:00","1851 N OAKLAND AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53202-0000","Exterior of Building in Disrepair","","Door needs repair""2025-08-19 00:00:00","323 E OKLAHOMA AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53207-2630","Missed Collection: Garbage","","g-carts at collection point""2025-08-19 00:00:00","1532 S 37TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53215-0000","Construction Concerns","","There’s about 15 temporary barricades that the city of Milwaukee used when they built the roundabouts.

For past 8 years since coming back to Milwaukee and neighbor hood I have resided on the corner of 58th and Vliet in a 4 family rental unit. . 58th street along with both 57th street, and 59th street are  and have been in deplorable condition. Several times i have contacted alderman Murphy before his retirement to report some huge pot holes and generally hazardous conditions of the streets, in particular 58th street from Vliet street south to the entrance to Hawthorne Glen park. Alderman Murphy always responded by sending out a DPW crew to patch up the worst of the pot holes and terrible condition of 58th street only to have the patches quickly disappear or just placing a band aide on a much more severe general street condition. There is no way to drive down 58th south from Vliet street avoiding multiple pot holes and generally terrible road surface. Are there any plans to at least consider the less costly resurfacing process that the city has employed on certain streets in the city to apply a smoother and sager driving service without complete street, curb, sidewalk replacement. Its truly a situation that has gone on far too long and I will begin to gather signatures or testimonies from my neighbors to validate my concerns. Would be grateful for any response from Alderman or the DPW division responsible for such matters. Thank You. Steve Hooser 1391 n. 58th St. #1 414-975-4564 email, stephenhooser53@gmail.com

At the corner of 100th street and Bender Road (2 houses down from address above) branches need to be removed, they are blocking water from exiting the street and the drains are clogged and under these piles of branches. Please remove the 90 degree corner blocking the drain and also the pile you see in the photo
2.) 30 feet from this corner you will see a huge pile of branches - the pile is the size of a large truck.
3.) There are 8-10 property owners on 101St Street between Bender and Mill road with branches that came down due to the storm and is still at the curb. (This is the very next street over from the address above)

I asked for the pets registration and pet liability insurance from the tenant. I haven't received it yet. When I asked the tenant on the 1St floor if she's had similar experiences with the dog, she said it went after her twins one day and she has to be careful when she leaves her apt with the children.

The flashing blue light from this camera cart shines directly past my closed blinds and into my apartment at night, located further down the road at 902 S 25th St. This constant and disruptive light has made it difficult to sleep and has become a significant nuisance.

I attempted to contact McDonald's directly to address the issue, but unfortunately, I did not receive any response. I also called their corporate toll-free number, but no one answered that call either. I am not sure whether McDonald's will take action on their own, so I am reaching out to your department in hopes that you can help resolve this situation.

I would like to request that the flashing blue light be turned off during the night or that the camera cart be moved to another part of the parking lot where the light does not affect nearby residents. This issue is causing unnecessary disturbance and discomfort, and I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in addressing it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and any steps you may take to resolve this nuisance.""2025-04-20 00:00:00","8310 W BURLEIGH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-4806","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","branches in alley next to garbage carts""2025-04-20 00:00:00","5730 W HOWARD AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53220-2065","No Mow May Registration","","""2025-04-20 00:00:00","5246 S 20TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53221-3854","Clogged Catch Basin/Surface Flooding","2025-04-20 00:00:00","WATER DEPT NEEDS CB OPEN FOR WORK THEY ARE DOING""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3629 S 84TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53228-1503","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","leaves and brush clippings""2025-04-20 00:00:00","7912 W BRADLEY RD, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53223-3230","Clogged Catch Basin/Surface Flooding","2025-04-20 00:00:00","Basin flooding during rain, Basin drain clog with debris""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3865 N 85TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-2825","Brush Pickup Request, Less than 2 Cubic Yards, April-November","","There are 2 piles as we dont have much of a curb in our cul-de-sac, thank you very much""2025-04-20 00:00:00","1221 N 31ST ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53208-2941","Large Items Discarded on Private Property","","Several tires have been dumped in the alley behind this property""2025-04-20 00:00:00","3930 N 26TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53206-1405","Trim City Tree","","I requested a city tree to be trimmed.

Over the past several weeks, I have noticed the presence of one or two mice on and off within the apartment, and despite my repeated concerns to my landlord, **Devoe Rentals LLC**, the issue has not been adequately addressed.

I have informed the landlord on several occasions about the mice problem, but their response has been dismissive and lacking in action. They have offered excuses and have not taken any concrete steps to resolve the issue. As a tenant, I am paying **$450 per month** for this rental, and I believe it is unacceptable for the landlord to ignore this serious health and safety concern.

I understand that **Devoe Rentals LLC** has a history of similar complaints with your department, and I am requesting that appropriate action be taken against this landlord for their failure to maintain the property in a habitable condition. The continued presence of pests in my apartment makes it difficult for me to live in the space comfortably, and I should not have to endure this while paying rent.

I am asking that you investigate this matter further and hold the landlord accountable for not addressing the issue. It is not fair to continue to pay rent in these conditions when they have not taken the necessary steps to address the problem.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.""2025-04-20 00:00:00","902 S 25TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53204-0000","Plumbing Problem","","I am submitting a formal complaint regarding a persistent plumbing issue at **902 S 25th St, Milwaukee, WI 53204**, specifically with the second-floor bathroom tub.

The issue is that the bathtub in this bathroom fills with water whenever the shower head is in use, for no apparent reason. I am unsure whether this is an ongoing issue that has not been reported previously, or if it is a new problem that has gone unnoticed. Regardless, it is causing inconvenience and concerns regarding potential water damage or further plumbing complications.

I have informed my landlord, **Devoe Rentals LLC**, about this problem on several occasions, but they have refused to take any action or address the issue in any way. This lack of response has prompted me to reach out to your department for assistance.

Additionally, I have come to learn that Devoe Rentals LLC has a **history of complaints with the Milwaukee Department of Neighborhood Services**. It appears that they have a pattern of neglecting tenant concerns and providing substandard living conditions while continuing to collect rent payments from hard-working Milwaukee residents. It is disheartening to see that these landlords appear to operate without regard for the well-being or safety of their tenants.

Given the serious nature of the plumbing issue, the landlord’s failure to address it, and their history of neglect, I am requesting that the **Milwaukee Department of Neighborhood Services investigate this matter** as soon as possible. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in ensuring that this issue is resolved in a timely and professional manner.

Thank you for your attention to this complaint. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.""2025-04-19 00:00:00","8042 W CENTER ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-4925","No Mow May Registration","","""2025-04-19 00:00:00","3008 N 60TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53210-1403","No Hot Water","","The landlord is retaliating against my elderly grandmother by turning off her hot water.

Not only is he a hoarder within the home and in his car, which has caused a plethora of insects and vermin to encroach within his property, but his mental illness has progressed, which is decreasing our property values. Kevin throws food on the side walk and within his front yard including: pork knuckle bones, ribs, turkey carcasses, rice, corn flakes, various fruits and vegetables, eggs, marshmellos, hot dog buns, bagles, and other products to name a few which are left overs he receives from the food pantry. This leftover waste ends up in my front and back yard or under my car, including the bones and scraps. This has also attracted unwanted rodents and other vermin to the area, including excess squirrels, raccoons, crows, mice, and furthermore attracted the stray cat population. The cats now take harbor under my deck and urinate consistently, ruining my yard. The problem is that much of the food which is laid out goes uneaten as these animals are not adapted to eat items, such as marshmallows and corn flakes. Several neighbors, including Edward Steward, residing at 6221 N 63rd St, Milwaukee, WI 53218, also have expressed to me that this debris has become a problem within his yard. We have expressed our dissatisfaction with the problem to Kevin in a pleasant manner, but he does not take our complaints seriously and continues the pattern. This has occurred for over 2 years and has only increased in the past few months. I am seeking help to stop this. I am concerned for my health as I recently found a rodent within my garage, which I know is attributable to this increase in left out waste.

There is a storage room in the basement that has a very musty and mildew-like odor. You can’t see the source of the moisture, but you can smell it. In mid-December I first reported it to him. At first my landlord was very responsive and seemed to care. The first mold specialist that he sent looked at the room and said “oh, it’s a safe mold, if there is any mold” and did no testing whatsoever. Weeks later, I do my own mold testing and pay for it out of my own pocket. I followed the instructions exactly and tested in various areas in the room. Including by the pipe, by the walls (where the first mold specialist assumed there could be mold.) My testing showed Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium was found. One of the samples I did right by the pipe and wall, and that was the most severe. I go to my landlord with all this information and share the reports and he sends a second mold specialist out to do his own testing. That was almost 3 weeks ago on January 13th and I haven’t heard one thing in response from my landlord about the results or any remediation plans. I think this is an uninhabitable condition for ME and MY family. I must be particularly sensitive to molds. A lot of people are so I’m not sure why everyone is downplaying this and not doing any further investigation. My dog is constantly itchy and can’t even stay at the house anymore. I am done being ignored by my landlord and I’m ready to figure out a solution or get me out of this house.""2025-02-01 00:00:00","2496 W FOND DU LAC AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53206-1015","Street Light Out","2025-02-02 00:00:00","Area dark south of Tamarack southbound""2025-02-01 00:00:00","801 E RESERVOIR AV, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53212-3482","Graffiti","","located in kadish Park at the band shell""2025-01-31 00:00:00","9034 W METCALF PL, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53222-2752","Christmas Tree Pickup (DO NOT USE)","2025-01-31 00:00:00","""2025-01-31 00:00:00","2625 S 70TH ST, MILWAUKEE, WI, 53219-2508","Recycling Cart: No Cart","","The cart has been missing since was damaged for over 1 week.

There is a temporary round a bout at the intersection of 61st & chambers. Someone hit one of the signs so now there are only 3 signs where there should be 4.
